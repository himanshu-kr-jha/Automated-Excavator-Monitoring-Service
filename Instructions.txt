Make Docker image containing only following files:
    -best.pt
    -Dockerfile
    -process_video.py
    -requirement.txt
Push it on ECR Repository named excavator_monitoring

Further steps:

1. Create S3 bucket for video-input : excavator-video-input
2. Create S3 bucket for video-output: excavator-video-output

3. Create Policy on IAM using provided Policy: excavator-monitor-s3-policy.json
4. Create Role on IAM : excavator-monitor-taskRole containing above created policy and AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess

5. Setup Amazon ECS:
    a. Create Cluster with name : excavator-monitor-cluster
    b. Create TaskDefinition and in container define the image you formed earlier with name [excavator-monitor-container] 
    c. Task Definition:  excavator-monitor-task:4  (this can differ as per the version of the image)

6. Create AWS lambda function to trigger S3 input bucket.
    -Make sure to create it with new role with ECSFullAccess and Attach policy of S3ReadOnlyAccess
    -Use the lambda_function.py code in the funtion you created.
    -Put the trigger for the input bucket(excavator-video-input)
    -Deploy the function.

Now you are good to go to to see if its working.
